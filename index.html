        <p>
            A full time student by the name of Chad Fouts, I once had the goal of owning a business in the field of entertainment. I had been focused on Marketing as my major in college, but since then things have changed with the coming of Corona and I am now pursuing a career in computer science and software development. My current pursuit is the completion of the TEKsystems boot camp.

            <li>Video Games</li>
                <p>
                    Gaming is my preferred form of entertainment and relaxation, it can be social where I would take time to spend with friends in a game we all enjoy, or I could play a single player game for the story based experience.
                </p>
            <li>Creative Writing</li>
                <p>
                    Literature has always been a big part of my life. Creating stories, either for my own enjoyment or the enjoyment of others, is a fun and rewarding experience.
                </p>
            <li>Movies</li>
                <p>
                    Film is a personal passion of mine, previously being the focus of my career. Now I consider myself a movie buff, always interested to find more titles and genres of film that I can enjoy.
                </p>
            <li>Laughing</li>
                <p>
                    I consider myself to be a very social person, and I love to laugh. Spending time with friends and bringing joy to them through an uplifting enviornment is very important to me.
